ROS was chosen as a development platform due primarily to its generic implementation of various robot navigation and localization algorithms. A Hokuyo URG-04LX-UG01 scanning laser rangefinder was used for sensing and mapping. Odometry estimates were read from the Pioneerâ€™s onboard electronics. An indoor space was first mapped using the target platform and sensors via ROS. This map was then used to seed real-time SLAM and path-planning algorithms. The robot was successfully guided by the above software to navigate through narrow, cluttered spaces and dynamic environments with various obstacles.' )
